# GA-Wordle
General Assembly Wordle Project

## What it is
My application is a game called wordle where you have 6 guesses to find a certain 5 letter word. You will be prompted to enter a word and then once enter is clicked, the site will analyse which letters are correct and in the right spot (colored green), which letters are in the word but placed in the wrong position (colored yellow) and which letters are not in the word at all (blank).

## Technologies used
I have used the technologies learned in my GA class to build this as it was the logic I understood and could use to make this game work.

## Challenges
A challenge I faced was working out my delete button as it involved using my existing code to sync with the delete button code as i had to incorporate both strings used for the text content of the divs as well as the delete button.

## A link to the site

- Not enough letters (if statement) not keeping old text and restarting from box 1
